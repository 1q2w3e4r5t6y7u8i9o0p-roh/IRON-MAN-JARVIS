# IRON-MAN-JARVIS
Jarvis is a fully accelerated, application framework for building multimodal conversational AI services that use an end-to-end deep learning pipeline (Figure 1).  The Jarvis framework includes pretrained conversational AI models, tools, and optimized end-to-end services for speech, vision, and NLU tasks. In addition to AI services, Jarvis enables you to fuse vision, audio, and other sensor inputs simultaneously to deliver capabilities such as multi-user, multi-context conversations in applications such as virtual assistants, multi-user diarization, and call center assistants.  Using Jarvis, you can easily fine-tune state-of-art-models on your data to achieve a deeper understanding of their specific contexts. Optimize for inference to offer real-time services that run in 150 ms compared to the 25 seconds required on CPU-only platforms.
